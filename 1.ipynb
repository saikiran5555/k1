    "The KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is a simple and versatile algorithm that can be applied to various types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In KNN classification, the algorithm assigns a class label to an unseen data point based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the feature space. The value of k is a hyperparameter that needs to be specified beforehand, and it determines the number of neighbors considered when making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In KNN regression, the algorithm predicts the numerical value of an unseen data point by taking the average or weighted average of the target values of its k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is a non-parametric algorithm, meaning it doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. It is often used for its simplicity and ease of implementation, but it may not perform well with high-dimensional data or when the dataset is large, as it requires calculating distances between all pairs of data points.\n",
