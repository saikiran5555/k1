    "k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Since KNN relies on calculating distances between data points to determine similarity, the scale of features can significantly impact the distance calculations. Here's how feature scaling affects KNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "Equal Importance of Features: Feature scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance calculation. Without scaling, features with larger magnitudes may dominate the distance metric, leading to biased results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improves Convergence: Scaling features to a similar range can improve the convergence of the algorithm during the distance calculation process. It helps prevent features with larger scales from overshadowing those with smaller scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance Metric Consistency: Scaling features ensures consistency in the choice of distance metric. For example, using the Euclidean distance metric on features with different scales may not accurately represent the true distance between points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhances Model Performance: Properly scaled features can lead to improved model performance, including higher accuracy and better generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common methods of feature scaling include:\n",

    "By applying feature scaling before applying the KNN algorithm, you ensure that the distances between data points are computed accurately and that each feature contributes proportionally to the overall similarity measure. This, in turn, can lead to more reliable and interpretable results from the KNN model.\n",
