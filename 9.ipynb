    "In the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the choice of distance metric plays a crucial role in determining how the \"nearest neighbors\" are identified.

    "Characteristics: Manhattan distance is especially useful in grid-like pathfinding problems and scenarios where travel is restricted to orthogonal (axis-aligned) paths. It is considered less \"natural\" than Euclidean distance for most physical distances but can be more appropriate in urban or grid-like environments.\n",
    "Choosing Between Them in KNN\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: Euclidean distance can be more sensitive to outliers than Manhattan distance because it squares the differences, amplifying the effect of large differences.\n",
    "Dimensionality: In high-dimensional spaces, the choice between Euclidean and Manhattan distance can significantly affect performance and results. Some studies suggest Manhattan distance might perform better in high-dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality, but this can depend on the specific characteristics of the data.\n",
    "Problem Specifics: The choice between these distances should be guided by the nature of the problem, the geometry of the data space, and experimental results. For some datasets, Manhattan distance might better capture the inherent structure of the data, while for others, Euclidean distance is more appropriate."
