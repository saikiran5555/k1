    "The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm can be used for both classification and regression tasks, with the primary difference between the two applications being the way in which the output is determined based on the neighbors. Here’s a breakdown of the differences between KNN classifier and KNN regressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN Classifier\n",
    "Purpose: KNN classifier is used for classification tasks, where the aim is to assign a discrete label (class) to an unseen instance based on the labels of its nearest neighbors.\n",
    "Output: The output is a class label. For a given query point, the KNN classifier looks at the k nearest neighbors and assigns the class that is most common among those neighbors. In the case of a tie, it may choose the class based on a distance metric or another tie-break mechanism.\n",
    "Decision Rule: Majority voting is often used. If k=5, and three neighbors belong to class A, and two belong to class B, the algorithm assigns the class A to the query point.\n",
    "KNN Regressor\n",
    "Purpose: KNN regressor is used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous value for an unseen instance based on the values of its nearest neighbors.\n",
    "Output: The output is a numerical value. For a given query point, the KNN regressor calculates the average (or sometimes the weighted average) of the target values of the k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "Decision Rule: Mean or weighted mean of the neighbors' values. If k=5, the regressor takes the target values of these five neighbors and computes their average as the prediction.\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "Type of Task: Classifier is for categorical outcomes (classes), while regressor is for continuous outcomes (numerical values).\n",
    "Output: Classifier outputs class labels, regressor outputs numerical values.\n",
    "Decision Process: Classifier uses voting (or similar mechanisms) to decide the class, whereas regressor uses averaging (or weighted averaging) of neighbors’ values.\n",
    "Similarities\n",
    "Despite these differences, both KNN classifiers and regressors share the core KNN methodology of predicting the outcome based on the nearest neighbors in the feature space. They both involve the choice of k, the method for measuring distance (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan), and the necessity of scaling the feature space to ensure fair distance comparisons."
