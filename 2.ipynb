    "Trial and Error: One simple approach is to try different values of \n",

    "k and evaluate the performance of the model using cross-validation or a validation set. Plotting the accuracy or error rate versus \n",
    "�\n",
    "k can help identify an optimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Odd Values: If the number of classes is even, it's often recommended to choose an odd value for \n",
    "�\n",
    "k. This helps to avoid ties when determining the class of a new data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Square Root Rule: A rule of thumb is to set \n",
    "�\n",
    "k to the square root of the number of samples in the training set. This can provide a good balance between bias and variance.\n",

    "Domain Knowledge: Consider domain-specific knowledge that might indicate a suitable range for \n",

    "�\n",
    "k may vary. Experimenting with different distance metrics and corresponding values of \n",
