    "The performance of a \n",
    "�\n",
    "k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model can be evaluated using various metrics depending on the nature of the problem (classification or regression). Here are some common evaluation metrics for both classification and regression tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification Tasks:\n",
    "Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances. It's a simple and intuitive metric but may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision, Recall, and F1-score: Useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Precision measures the proportion of true positives out of all predicted positives, recall measures the proportion of true positives out of all actual positives, and F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion Matrix: A table showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance across different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC): Particularly useful for binary classification tasks. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, and AUC represents the area under the ROC curve. A higher AUC indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kappa Statistic: Measures the agreement between predicted and actual class labels, accounting for the possibility of agreement occurring by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression Tasks:\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It provides a measure of the average magnitude of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It penalizes large errors more than MAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the MSE. It's in the same units as the target variable and provides a more interpretable measure than MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "�\n",
    "2\n",
    "R \n",
    "2\n",
    "  Score (Coefficient of Determination): Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted \n",
    "�\n",
    "2\n",
    "R \n",
    "2\n",
    "  Score: Similar to \n",
    "�\n",
    "2\n",
    "R \n",
    "2\n",
    "  score but adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. It penalizes the addition of unnecessary predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating KNN models, it's essential to consider the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the analysis to choose the most appropriate performance metrics. Additionally, cross-validation techniques can provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance by assessing its generalization ability across different subsets of the data."
